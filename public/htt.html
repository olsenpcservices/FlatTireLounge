             <strong>Second annual High Trestle Trail Celebration Ride Sat.</strong></p>

             <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jon Lloyd</strong></p>

             <p style="text-align: center;">Staff Writer</p>

             <p>Scott Olsen plans on riding his Trek road bike along the full length of the High Trestle Trail with a
                 few family members on Saturday.</p>

             <p>If the weather’s good, they could meet dozens of other cyclists riding the 25 miles from Madrid to
                 Ankeny and back, roughly a 50-mile trek. They’ll stop in the Nite Hawk Bar &amp; Grill, or perhaps the
                 Takedown, in Slater, he said. No doubt, they’ll converse with others &#8211; joggers, roller bladders,
                 horse back riders or just plain strollers &#8211; out for the Second Annual High Trestle Trail
                 Celebration Ride.</p>

             <p>One of the event’s organizers and also a part owner of the Flat Tire Lounge that’s parked right off the
                 trail in Madrid, Olsen said there is no set time for the event or any one particular spot where people
                 will gather and celebrate.</p>

             <p>Rather, he said, this year businesses are taking the lead &#8211; mainly bars and restaurants &#8211;
                 with their own unique events to recognize the second official birthday of the trail, which has become
                 “the ride” for cyclists in central Iowa.</p>

             <p>“Last year, people said they would like to make it a yearly occasion,” Olsen said, referring to the
                 trail’s grand celebration last year in late April when hundreds of people congregated on its
                 spectacular 13-story-high bridge that spans the wide Des Moines River Valley a few miles west of
                 Madrid. It, too, has become a very popular destination spot for visitors and locals alike in central
                 Iowa.</p>

             <p>Olsen said that Lisa Hein, the director of the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation that spearheaded the
                 development of the $15 million trial that was seven years in the making, estimated that about 2,000
                 people attended last year’s celebration.</p>

             <p>“About four, five of use tried to get local businesses together and have events,” said Olson. “This year
                 we want to focus on getting them off the trail. Last year they were mainly on the trail and towns had
                 functions. This year we’re relying on the businesses in each town.”</p>

             <p>And it’s not just for cyclists, Olsen said.</p>

             <p>“Anybody is welcome to join in and head out and take part that day,” he said. “Rollerbladers, people
                 that ride horses, walkers, runners.”</p>

             <p>Olsen said his group will set out from the Flat Tire in Madrid at about 6:30 a.m. and ride to Cayanne’s
                 Café, a new restaurant in Woodward which is joining in the celebration, and then pedal on to
                 Ankeny.</p>

             <p>“We’ll take a leisurely route back,” said Olsen, an avid cyclist who tries to get in a good ride several
                 times a week. “We’ll stop at Slater and go to Takedown or Nite Hawk or both. TakeDown is having a
                 band.”</p>

             <p>So is the Flat Tire, he said, The Lew and Brad Band. The outdoor patio, just finished yesterday, will be
                 open, along with a roped-off area for a beer garden, he said.</p>

             <p>The two bars, Nite Hawk Bar &amp; Grill and the TakeDown, are two of the four businesses in the
                 Slater/Sheldahl area that have celebration plans. Crossroads Tavern in Kelley has planned a deck party,
                 sand volleyball and $2 domestic draws.</p>

             <p>Fittingly, Madrid’s celebration will spill across town and includes a city-wide garage sale, the Lion’s
                 and Mason’s pancake breakfast at 7 a.m., and drink and food specials at the city’s two new eateries:
                 Baldy’s Chill &amp; Grill and Saddles BBQ Bistsro, both on South State Street a few pedal cranks down
                 from the High Trestle Trail.</p>

             <p>“It’s weather-dependent,” Olsen said of the possible turnout, “but if it’s a nice sunny day, it should
                 be packed.”</p>
